# shopping-behavior



[In this Project we are evaluating what the shopping of everyday people and there habit. It will demonstrate if people pay with different payments additionally what is more in trend depending one seasons. Futhermore we will also see what people from all around buy and use promo-code to make purchases]

## Observations 


[What I did was try to see what data we are working with and seeing if we has any null values that will interupt our data and will give us a false data set. After cleaning the data by removing some values we start to show how the null values might also play some truth to our data set which helped us form a null hypothesis. After cleaning data we show different seasosn with a pivot table on what color and clothing is popular throught the seasons. What I observed is usually in the summer people tend to buy more colorful cloths that are bright and then in winter and fall it tends to be more cloths that are darker. Some challanges that have been encounter in the code is being able to seperate promo-codes with non promo and changing the column without interfering with the data. ]
